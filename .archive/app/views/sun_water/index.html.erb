  <h2>Sun and Water</h2>
  <p>All living things derive their energy from the sun, and none can live without water. The balance between
    sun and water defines what is possible for a plant.</p>

<h2>Insolation Model</h2>
<p>We're proud to offer the "take" from the UW Space Science insolation model, which estimates insolation at the surface by comparing
  each pixel of a satellite image with one taken when no clouds are present. This model, which has undergone over a decade of rigorous
  quality control and continual improvement, offers a remarkably good fit to data obtained from ground instruments.</p>
<p>Daily solar energy amounts are estimated using data in the visible portion of the spectrum which come from the
  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Simple physical models of radiative transfer for
  the clear and cloudy atmosphere are used with these data to evaluate whether a particular location is cloudy
  or clear and, if cloudy, to what extent clouds have depleted the solar beam. Usually, about eight to twelve
  individual GOES images are used during the course of a day to make estimates of the solar energy at the satellite
  image times. These instantaneous estimates are later summed to produce the daily solar energy totals.</p>

<h2>Evapotranspiration Model</h2>
<p>Maps of potential evapotranspiration (ET) are calculated from satellite-derived measurements of solar radiation
  and air temperatures at regional airports. The ET values on the maps are a reasonable estimate of daily crop water
  use for most crops that have reached at least 80% coverage of the ground. Prior to 80% or greater coverage, ET
  will be a fraction of the map value in proportion to the amount of coverage. The map values may vary slightly from
  ET estimates from AWON and other more site-specific models, but these differences are believed to be within the
  uncertainty of even measurements of actual water use made directly in a given field.</p>
