Here's some notes I made as I looked at these programs. I'm half asleep so don't check my grammar.

*****************************************************************
KanSched - Nice looking UI except too much on-screen documentation leading to too much navigation. Reasonably intuitive operation. Poorly set up for multiple pivots. Should be importing soil data. Not much help on where to find data. Forecast screen is good, but needs to show results for all pivots. Water information screen seems useful, but may need customizing for Wisconsin.

Wis Spreadsheet - Not much multiple pivot management. Should be importing soil data. Has better explanation of where to get data. Cryptic labels. Is good documentation for new code development.

Questions
- Design and implementation
Why isn't the spreadsheet adequate?
Who will use this(farmer, staff, farm wife, consultants)? What level of computer expertise? In what situations (office/ field?).
How is it used? Whats the workflow? Deployed where (desktop, web, phone)?
Is there a future GIS requirement? How does that affect design?
What are actual development resources(Identify promised time and actual time). Limit scope while allowing for future improvements. How is maintenance (bug fixing) funded after release?
Who's writing documentation? Training?
Other development costs (installation or tools?).

- **** How many pivots per operation. ****
Multi pivot data management/reporting/charting

- Availability of data
AD data for crops (spreadsheet table to start). What other crops needed? How to update crop database?
Crop coefficient data for crops from where?
Percent cover models for crops? Data entry?
Soil data lookup from soil mapping unit. Multiple MU's?
Weather data download. Rainfall? Future of ET service?

- **** Reporting ****
Alerts and warnings / dashboard. Grower wants to see whole operation and identify problem areas before crisis.
DNR or county reporting requirements?
Cost tracking?
Missing data reports.

- Data protection/exchange
Backup
Export/Import
