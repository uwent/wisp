This project encapsulates a Allowable Depletion (AD) and Adjusted ET calculators for use in agricultural modeling, such as irrigation schedulers.

The source lives as part of the Wisconsin Irrigation Scheduling Program, see wisp.cals.wisc.edu for more details.

Test code is in the "test" folder and uses Test::Unit; the Rakefile in this folder runs those tests, so change folders ("cd" in the
command line) to this one and simply run "rake" to run the tests.

To rebuild the gem, "cd" to this folder and run "gem build asigbiophys.gemspec".
